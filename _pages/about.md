I hold an MSc in Statistics from the [London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics), where I focused on statistical modeling, machine learning, and quantitative finance. My professional experience includes roles as a Quantitative Researcher at [BNP Paribas](https://cib.bnpparibas/) and at several hedge funds in China, where I developed and implemented trading strategies, including market-making and trend-following algorithms, achieving notable success in live trading.

My expertise spans reinforcement learning and market microstructure analysis, with a strong track record of achievements, such as the Optiver & LSE Coding Challenge. Proficient in Python, R, and machine learning frameworks, I am passionate about leveraging data-driven approaches to solve complex financial and analytical challenges.
