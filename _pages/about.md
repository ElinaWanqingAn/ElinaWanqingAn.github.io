I hold an MSc in Statistics from the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics">London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)</a>, where I focused on statistical modeling, machine learning, and quantitative finance. My professional experience includes roles as a Quantitative Researcher at <a href="https://cib.bnpparibas/">BNP Paribas</a> and at several hedge funds in China, where I developed and implemented trading strategies, achieving notable success in live trading.

I embarked on my journey in quantitative disciplines at an early age. I won the Silver medal in the Asia and Pacific Informatics Olympiad (APIO) and the first prize in the National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces (NOIP) in China. Currently, my expertise spans machine learning and market microstructure analysis, with a strong track record of achievements, such as the Optiver & LSE Coding Challenge. Proficient in Python, R, and machine learning frameworks, I am passionate about leveraging data-driven approaches to solve complex financial and analytical challenges.
